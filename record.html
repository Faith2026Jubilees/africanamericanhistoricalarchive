      <p>
        This photograph documents agricultural labor in the late nineteenth century. It is preserved here as part of the
        African American Historical Archive’s foundational phase: Slavery through Reconstruction (1619–1877) and its immediate aftermath.

        <p>
          The image does not provide names, wages, or consent. What it presents as ordinary—Black labor as background—is itself historical evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We preserve this record to keep historical memory visible and intact, and to hold the documented lives behind the archive with seriousness rather than distance.
